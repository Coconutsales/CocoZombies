POPZOMB STARTS at 5

CANNOT BE LOWER THAN 1

CANNOT BE HIGHER THAN POPCOUNT


when lowering,
if popZomb > 1, then decrease by 1

when raising
if popZomb < popCount, then increase by 1

CocoZombies V1.2
ALREADY CHANGED:
Hotkey for increase / decrease Zombie Population 
- Increase: ] and Decrease: [
- Minimum 1, maximum '20,000' (Max is the current population)
- Made an iterative spawning statement for creating zombies
-- previously hardcoded to spawn 4 zombies in sequence
-- Allows easier adjustment of zombie starting population :)

Larger simulation window

Adjusted Human/Dead/Zombie counter positions

Replaced "num" variable with "popCount" which is calculated from a formula including two new variables, popMax and popMin

Fixed offset Bomb crater placement
- Visual was offset from area of effect, causing walls to be destroyed to the top left of where you click but killing anything centered on the mouse
- Original code had mouse position coords reduced by radius of the generated bomb, for some reason. (mouseX-radius, mouseY-radius)

Added hotkey and boolean to enable and disable zombie lifespan
- 'enableDecay' by default set to false
- Currently, while disabled, will kill zombies instantly when enabled as zombielife always counts down.

Changed reset hotkey to "r / R" from "z / Z"

TO DO:

Set LMB to small bomb (same,) set RMB to NUKE
- maybe on a "WMD enabled" toggle, so LMB and RMB by default can be small bomb and medium bomb
-- then WMD enabled can be Endothermic Bomb and Nuclear Bomb (large and XL)

Map generation from a seed
- allow for restarting the same generation
- possibly enter a seed at some point

Other weapon toggles, like:
- LMB for placing WALL, RMB for placing EMPTY
- LMB for placing Humans, RMB for placing Zombies?

Make enableDecay properly track existing array entries for zombielife
- Make it so that enabling from disabled doesn't instantly kill zombies if it has always been disabled
-- Doesn't start counting until Enabled
-- Maybe it counts UP? Higher count makes a slower zombie until death, or if decay disabled until a maximum?
- Make it so you can enable and disable, and zombielife value only tracks while decay was enabled

Make a version where zombies follow the mouse? idk how
